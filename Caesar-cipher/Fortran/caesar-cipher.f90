  character(1110) :: message = "the action of a caesar cipher is to replace each plaintext letter with a different one a fixed number of places down the alphabet. the cipher illustrated here uses a left shift of three, so that each occurrence of e in the plaintext becomes b in the ciphertext.in cryptography, a caesar cipher, also known as caesars cipher, the shift cipher, caesars code or caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. it is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. for example, with a left shift of 3, d would be replaced by a, e would become b, and so on. the method is named after julius caesar, who used it in his private correspondence. the encryption step performed by a caesar cipher is often incorporated as part of more complex schemes, such as the vigen√®re cipher, and still has modern application in the rot13 system. as with all single-alphabet substitution ciphers, the caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern practice offers essentially no communication security."
